PATTERN 3 — BRANCHING RECURSION PRACTICE SET

LEVEL 1: BASIC BRANCHING (WARM-UP)

1. ✅ Fibonacci Number
   Input: n
   Output: nth Fibonacci number
   Calls: n-1, n-2

2. ✅ Climbing Stairs (1 or 2 steps)
   Input: n
   Output: number of ways
   Same structure as Fibonacci

3. Count Binary Strings of Length N
   Input: n
   Output: count only (do NOT print)

4. Print Binary Strings of Length N
   Input: n
   Output: all strings of 0/1


LEVEL 2: DECISION-BASED RECURSION

5. ✅ Print All Strings of Length N Using {a, b}
   Example for n=2: aa ab ba bb

6. ✅ Print All Strings of Length N Using Digits {0,1,2}
   Branches = 3 per call

7. Generate All Dice Outcomes (1–6) of Length N
   Example: rolling dice n times

8. Print All Paths to Reach N Using 1 or 2 Steps
   Print paths like: 1-1-2, 2-2, etc.


LEVEL 3: SUBSEQUENCE / INCLUDE–EXCLUDE (VERY IMPORTANT)

9. Print All Subsequences of a String
   Input: "abc"
   Output:
   ""
   a
   b
   c
   ab
   ac
   bc
   abc

10. Count Subsequences of a String
    Do NOT print

11. Print All Subsequences With Sum = K
    Input: array + target sum

12. Subset Sum Count
    Return number of subsets with sum = K


LEVEL 4: GRID / PATH PROBLEMS

13. Count Paths in a Grid (Right / Down)
    From (0,0) to (m,n)

14. Print All Paths in a Grid
    Moves: R, D

15. Count Paths With Obstacles
    Some cells blocked


LEVEL 5: INTERVIEW-LEVEL TREE THINKING

16. Generate Parentheses (n pairs)

17. Letter Combinations of Phone Number

18. Maze Paths with 4 Directions

19. Count Ways to Partition a Number

20. Print All Ways to Make Change (Coins)
