🔁 Counting and Printing (Very Basic)

- ✅ Print numbers from 1 to N ✅
- ✅ Print numbers from N to 1 ✅
- ✅ Print all even numbers from 1 to N ✅
- ✅ Print all odd numbers from N to 1 ✅
- ✅ Print each digit of a number (e.g., 123 → 1, 2, 3) ✅

🔄 Return Values (Sum, Product, etc.)

- ✅ Return the sum of numbers from 1 to N ✅
- ✅ Return the factorial of N ✅
- ✅ Return the N-th Fibonacci number ✅
- ✅ Count how many times a digit (e.g., 7) appears in a number
- Return the sum of digits of a number (e.g. 1001 => 1+0+0+1 => 2)

🧠 Arrays & Strings

- Print all elements of an array using recursion
- Return the sum of all elements in an array
- Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion
- Count how many times a character appears in a string recursively
- Find the maximum element in an array recursively

⚒️ Build and Return (Construct values or arrays)

- Build and return an array from 1 to N
- Build and return an array from N to 1
- Return a reversed version of an array recursively
- Return a new string with characters in reverse order
- Remove all occurrences of a specific character from a string

🧩 Slightly Trickier (Logic Building)

- Return true if a number is a power of 2
- Return true if an array is sorted (in ascending order)
- Generate all numbers from 1 to N where the sum of digits is less than K
- Count number of subsets in an array whose sum equals a target
- Generate all binary strings of length N
