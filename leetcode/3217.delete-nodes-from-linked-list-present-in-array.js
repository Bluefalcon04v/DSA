3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array

You are given an array of integers nums and the head of a linked list. Return the head of the modified linked list after removing all nodes from the linked list that have a value that exists in nums.
 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3], head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [4,5]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1], head = [1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2,2,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5], head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

function modifiedList(nums, head) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    
  }
}
